    Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us.
    It eluded us then, but that’s no matter — tomorrow we will run faster, stretch our arms further...
    And one fine morning — So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.
